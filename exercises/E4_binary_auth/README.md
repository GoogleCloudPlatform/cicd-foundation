# Exercise 4: Verifying the images

## Check what are the CVEs affecting your image

ðŸ‘‰ Go to Artifact Registry, select the latest image, and select the Vulnerabilities tab.   

## Check what is the current Binary Authorization and Kritis policies. 

ðŸ‘‰ Go to Binary Authorization in Console to vizualize the policy.  
ðŸ‘‰ Go to your local `cicd/kritis` folder to vizualize the kritis policy. 

## Introduce a vulnerability

ðŸ‘‰ Inside your `main.go`` file, import and use a library with a vulnerability. For example, uncomment the following: 

```go
	"gopkg.in/yaml.v2"
```

```go
	// Sample call to an outdated library
	var a struct{}
	data := []byte("Foo: bar")
	err := yaml.Unmarshal(data, &a)
	_ = err
```

ðŸ‘‰ commit these and push to the repository.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "introduced an old library with vulnerabilities"
git push google
```

ðŸ‘‰ Check the results of Cloud Build and Cloud Deploy.  
If you try to promote your release to PROD, it will fail.

ðŸ‘‰ Go to Artifact Registry, to see the Vulnerabilities introduced.
