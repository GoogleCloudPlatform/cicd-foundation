# Exercise 3: Outer development loop 📝

Now that we successfully ran and validated the application let's deploy it through secure CI/CD pipelines.

That is, for the outer development loop we are adopting GitOps.
This way we profit from full automation triggered by pushing to the repository.

## Push your changes

<details>
<summary>VSCode</summary>

👉 Open the Source Control panel with `Control`+`Shift`+`G`, write a commit message, and press `Control`+`Enter`

#### References 🔗

- [Version control with Cloud Workstations](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/version-control#commit_changes)
</details><br/>

<details>
<summary>Terminal</summary>

👉 Add your changes with
```sh
git add .
```

and

👉 commit these and push to the repository.
```sh
git commit -m "customized greeting"
git push private
```
</details>

## Continuous Integration

This will trigger a CI pipeline with Cloud Build.

👉 Watch the build and push to Artifact Registry in the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds).

## Continuous Deployment

As a last step of the CI pipeline, a new release will be created.
This in trun triggers the CD pipeline.

👉 Navigate to [Cloud Deploy](https://console.cloud.google.com/deploy/delivery-pipelines) and watch the rollout(s) of the release (after rendering).

## Validate

👉 Finally validate deployment with `curl` (after establishing a port-forwarding if necessary).

<details>
<summary>curl</summary>

👉 First, fetch the credentials for accessing the Kubernetes cluster in PROD environment.

<details>
<summary>gcloud</summary>

```sh
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME --region $CLUSTER_REGION
```

#### References 🔗

- [gcloud container clusters get-credentials](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/get-credentials)
</details><br/>

👉 Next, establish port-forwarding. Finally call `curl`.

```sh
kubectl port-forward deployments/hello-world 9000:8080 &
curl http://127.0.0.1:9000
kill %1
```
