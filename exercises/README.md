# Workshop 2 - Hands On

## Objectives üéØ

The objectives of this workshop are twofold:

1. getting **hands-on** experience in your **real-life environment** with:
  - setting up, configuring, and customizing
    - a Cloud Workstation
    - developer tools
  - retrieving and working with code
    - using source code repositories
  - mastering the inner-development loop
    - application deployment
    - validation / testing
  - triggering the outer-development loop
    - pushing a change
    - observing the continuous integration pipeline execution
      - build of a container image
      - push to a container repository
      - signing of the image for binary authorization
    - observing the continuous deployment pipeline execution
      - release creation
      - rollout to a target after rendering of manifest
2. establishing an understanding and acquiring product knowledge (see below)
