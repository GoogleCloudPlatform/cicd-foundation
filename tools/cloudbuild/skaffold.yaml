# This is an example of a generic Cloud Build pipeline, showcasing how to use
# Skaffold in conjunction with Cloud Deploy.
# Generalization is realized through the _APP_NAME Cloud Build parameter
# (both used for the source directory and Cloud Deploy pipeline name).
# The first "build" step generates a container image and
# uploads it to a container repository (_SKAFFOLD_DEFAULT_REPO parameter)
# The second "createRelease" step creates a Cloud Deploy release based on the
# generated artifacts.json (from the first step) and triggers a
# Continuous Deploy pipeline for the application.
